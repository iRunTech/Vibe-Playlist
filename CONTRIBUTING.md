Thank you for wanting to contribute to Vibe Playlist! Your help makes this project better.

Please follow these simple steps to contribute smoothly:

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch from `main`:

   - git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Vibe-Playlist.git
   - git checkout -b feat/some-descriptive-name

2. Make small, focused changes. Keep commits atomic and add a helpful commit message.

3. Run and test locally by opening `index.html` in your browser. The app is single-file and needs no build step.

6. Wait for at least one approval from a project maintainer. Address review comments and push fixes to the same branch.

Notes and suggestions
- If your change touches many files, explain the motivation and provide screenshots or examples.
- Keep the UI and accessibility in mind (focus states, keyboard navigation, text contrast).
- If you add external libraries or services, explain why and include minimal reproduction steps.

Code of conduct
- Be respectful and inclusive. 

Thank you â€” I appreciate every contribution!
